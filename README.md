# About Me

 ## My Interests
 * Piano
     * I've been playing for around 7 years.
 * Music Production
     * I'm very bad at it.
 * Reading
     * I like philosophical, sci-fi, manga, and webnovels.

 ## Websites I Recommend
 1. [Cobalt](https://cobalt.tools)
   * This website lets you download media from social media sites like YouTube without ads, trackers, or other shady shenanigans. Most downloader sites feel very suspicious, so I feel thankful towards the developer that decided to create this very useful website.
 2. [FMHY](https://fmhy.net/)
   * This website provides guides on how to safely access media locked behind paywalls for free. I find it inspiring that it gives a wider audience--often people who can't afford it--the access to tap into the vast, unique culture that is solely found in media.
